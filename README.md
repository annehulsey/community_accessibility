# High-resolution Post-earthquake Recovery Simulation of Safety Cordons

This repository includes a python package for simulating the effect of safety cordons in a community, with the example case study implemented in the journal article: "High-resolution Post-earthquake Recovery Simulation: Impact of Safety Cordons".

Subfolder for the downtown San Francisco Case study:

Inputs and/or outputs for the case study can be found at (the DesignSafe Project DOI). To rerun the analysis, replace the empty inputs folder with the one stored on DesignSafe and run the Jupyter Notebook titled "Run Community Accessibility Analysis." To recreate the figures, replace the empty output and journal figures/gis_data folders with the ones stored on DesignSafe and run the respective Jupyter Notebooks in the journal figures folder.
